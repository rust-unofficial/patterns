# A succinct name for the pattern

## Description

A short, prose description of the pattern.

## Example

```rust
// An example of the pattern in action, should be mostly code, commented
// liberally.
```

When writing examples, please try to make them compile. This allows us to test
them. If you fail to write an example that is both complete and readable, please
at least mark your example code with `ignore` as in here:

```rust,ignore
// A non-runnable example of the pattern in action, should be mostly code, commented
// liberally.
```
