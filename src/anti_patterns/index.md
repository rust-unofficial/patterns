# Anti-patterns

An [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) is a solution to
a "recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly
counterproductive". Just as valuable as knowing how to solve a problem, is
knowing how _not_ to solve it. Anti-patterns give us great counter-examples to
consider relative to design patterns. Anti-patterns are not confined to code.
For example, a process can be an anti-pattern, too.
