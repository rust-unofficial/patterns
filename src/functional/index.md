# Functional Usage of Rust

Rust is an imperative language, but it follows many
[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigms.

> In computer science, *functional programming* is a programming paradigm where
> programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
> It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are
> trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of
> imperative statements which change the state of the program.
