# Creational Patterns

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern):

> Design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects
> in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could
> result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design
> patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
