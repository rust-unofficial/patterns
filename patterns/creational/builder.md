# Builder

## Description

Construct an object with calls to a builder helper.

## Example

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Foo {
    // Lots of complicated fields.
    bar: String,
}

impl Foo {
    // This method will help users to discover the builder
    pub fn builder() -> FooBuilder {
        FooBuilder::default()
    }
}

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct FooBuilder {
    // Probably lots of optional fields.
    bar: String,
}

impl FooBuilder {
    pub fn new(/* ... */) -> FooBuilder {
        // Set the minimally required fields of Foo.
        FooBuilder {
            bar: String::from("X"),
        }
    }

    pub fn name(mut self, bar: String) -> FooBuilder {
        // Set the name on the builder itself, and return the builder by value.
        self.bar = bar;
        self
    }

    // If we can get away with not consuming the Builder here, that is an
    // advantage. It means we can use the FooBuilder as a template for constructing
    // many Foos.
    pub fn build(self) -> Foo {
        // Create a Foo from the FooBuilder, applying all settings in FooBuilder
        // to Foo.
        Foo { bar: self.bar }
    }
}

#[test]
fn builder_test() {
    let foo = Foo {
        bar: String::from("Y"),
    };
    let foo_from_builder: Foo = FooBuilder::new().name(String::from("Y")).build();
    assert_eq!(foo, foo_from_builder);
}
```

## Motivation

Useful when you would otherwise require many constructors or where
construction has side effects.

## Advantages

Separates methods for building from other methods.

Prevents proliferation of constructors

Can be used for one-liner initialisation as well as more complex construction.

## Disadvantages

More complex than creating a struct object directly, or a simple constructor
function.

## Discussion

This pattern is seen more frequently in Rust (and for simpler objects) than in
many other languages because Rust lacks overloading. Since you can only have a
single method with a given name, having multiple constructors is less nice in
Rust than in C++, Java, or others.

This pattern is often used where the builder object is useful in its own right,
rather than being just a builder. For example, see
[`std::process::Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html)
is a builder for [`Child`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child.html)
(a process). In these cases, the `T` and `TBuilder` pattern
of naming is not used.

The example takes and returns the builder by value. It is often more ergonomic
(and more efficient) to take and return the builder as a mutable reference. The
borrow checker makes this work naturally. This approach has the advantage that
one can write code like

```rust,ignore
let mut fb = FooBuilder::new();
fb.a();
fb.b();
let f = fb.build();
```

as well as the `FooBuilder::new().a().b().build()` style.
