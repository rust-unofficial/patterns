# Clone to satisfy the borrow checker

## Description

The borrow checker prevents Rust users from developing otherwise unsafe code by
ensuring that either: only one mutable reference exists, or potentially many but
all immutable references exist. If the code written does not hold true to these
conditions, this anti-pattern arises when the developer resolves the compiler
error by cloning the variable.

## Example

```rust
// define any variable
let mut x = 5;

// Borrow `x` -- but clone it first
let y = &mut (x.clone());

// perform some action on the borrow to prevent rust from optimizing this
//out of existence
*y += 1;

// without the x.clone() two lines prior, this line would fail on compile as
// x has been borrowed
// thanks to x.clone(), x was never borrowed, and this line will run.
println!("{}", x);
```

## Motivation

It is tempting, particularly for beginners, to use this pattern to resolve
confusing issues with the borrow checker. However, there are serious
consequences. Using `.clone()` causes a copy of the data to be made. Any changes
between the two are not synchronized -- as if two completely separate variables
exist.

There are special cases -- `Rc<T>` is designed to handle clones intelligently.
It internally manages exactly one copy of the data, and cloning it will only
clone the reference.

There is also `Arc<T>` which provides shared ownership of a value of type T
that is allocated in the heap. Invoking `.clone()` on `Arc` produces a new `Arc`
instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the source `Arc`,
while increasing a reference count.

In general, clones should be deliberate, with full understanding of the
consequences. If a clone is used to make a borrow checker error disappear,
that's a good indication this anti-pattern may be in use.

Even though `.clone()` is an indication of a bad pattern, sometimes
**it is fine to write inefficient code**, in cases such as when:

- the developer is still new to ownership
- the code doesn't have great speed or memory constraints
  (like hackathon projects or prototypes)
- satisfying the borrow checker is really complicated, and you prefer to
  optimize readability over performance

If an unnecessary clone is suspected, The [Rust Book's chapter on Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html)
should be understood fully before assessing whether the clone is required or not.

Also be sure to always run `cargo clippy` in your project, which will detect some
cases in which `.clone()` is not necessary, like [1](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#redundant_clone),
[2](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#clone_on_copy),
[3](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#map_clone) or [4](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#clone_double_ref).
